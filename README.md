# ðŸ›’ Cool shopping page:

This is a project using React with Redux, React-testing-library, and Cypress to test the app. 
To take data about products, I used this nice project: http://fakestoreapi.com/ (thanks a lot to @keikaavousi for this awesome work, it is so helpful).

## About
Just for fun and to investigate with React, Redux, React testing library, and GithubActions. 
It's an ugly design, I know it ðŸ˜…, but if you want to give some feedback about, and help me to do it better I'm glad to ear suggestions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn test:once`
Launches the test runner just one time.

### `yarn cypress`

Follow this steps:
Run `yarn start`to run the server.
Run `yarn cypress`to run cypress enviroment and see the e2e test in a navigator. 

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!** ðŸ’¥

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
